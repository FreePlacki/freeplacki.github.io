## Riverpod

[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) describes itself as

> A Reactive Caching and Data-binding Framework

(for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)). But what's most interesting
<small>for me</small> is how it simplifies dependency injection and reactivity
by leveraging the idea of a Provider.

::: sidenote
The name riverpod is formed by rearanging the letters of
<div class="morph" data-state="source">
  <span class="char col0 c0">p</span>
  <span class="char col1 c1">r</span>
  <span class="char col2 c2">o</span>
  <span class="char col3 c3">v</span>
  <span class="char col4 c4">i</span>
  <span class="char col5 c5">d</span>
  <span class="char col6 c6">e</span>
  <span class="char col7 c7">r</span>
</div>
